# Warpkeep

**A real person. A permanent keep. A world worth returning to.**

Warpkeep is a persistent strategy world connected to Farcaster. Workers travel
across the landscape, resources come home, and a keep becomes a place shaped by
its Keeper's choices. We are building a game that makes the first session
satisfying and the next visit worthwhile.

## The next chapter

Warpkeep 0.4 brings the game together around a clear loop:

**Gather → choose → build → benefit → return.**

Choose where your Workers travel and when they return. Turn the resources they
bring home into a useful improvement. See that improvement change your keep
and make the next journey or construction project better. Return to a place
that remembers your effort and offers another worthwhile decision.

Our aim is a satisfying first session and meaningful choices beyond it.
Clear feedback, dependable progress, thoughtful pacing and comfortable mobile
controls are central to that experience. The 0.4 scope is a polished visual
foundation and dependable loop; deeper simulation, freeform editing and social
systems remain later milestones.

## The Verdant Citadel

The visual direction is an inviting town diorama: pale masonry, dark timber,
oxidized-teal roofs, restrained violet warp accents and warm signs of activity.
Layered forest, lightweight voxel scenery and flowing water frame the keep
without obscuring the decisions inside it.

We judge the result in the rendered game—its composition, readability, motion
and responsiveness. Detail should serve the experience on a phone as well as
on a desktop. Reused assets retain their original credits and permissions.

## Where development stands

**0.4 is being integrated; it is not yet the completed live release.** The
development branch includes the gameplay core, new keep presentation, session
renewal and local release/recovery tools. Connected owner play, visual refinement
and the complete operating path require their own current acceptance evidence.

| Realm | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Genesis 001** | Preserve the established world, existing player progress and agreed admission freeze. |
| **Genesis 002** | Prepare the successor realm as a sealed launch; its future admissions remain undecided. |
| **Owner PTR** | Exercise the new playable experience in an isolated realm before broader release. |

The [current development notes](docs/agent-notes/0.4.0/README.md) distinguish
implemented behavior, verified results, open integration work and live observations.
The [roadmap](docs/design/roadmap.md) explains how the first complete loop supports
future exploration, cooperation and strategy without promising unfinished features.

## Build with us

Active 0.4 development is on
[`codex/prepared-keep-bindings-fix`](https://github.com/ael-dev3/Warpkeep/tree/codex/prepared-keep-bindings-fix).
Check your branch before using a development guide; `main` and the running game
can represent different release stages.

For a fresh independent checkout, use Git, Node 22 (22.13 or newer within that
major) and npm 10.9.8:

```sh
git clone --branch codex/prepared-keep-bindings-fix https://github.com/ael-dev3/Warpkeep.git
cd Warpkeep
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the local address printed by Vite. To inspect a synthetic keep, open
`/dev/keep04-qa.html?scenario=all-six-level-five&quality=high` on that same local
origin. The fixture demonstrates presentation; it does not connect a real owner
or establish live gameplay acceptance. Follow [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and [the development workflow](docs/engineering/development-workflow.md) for
setup, verification, and existing-worktree guidance.

Stop the development server with `Ctrl+C` in its terminal.

The browser uses React, TypeScript and Three.js. Cloudflare verifies identity;
SpacetimeDB owns persistent gameplay; GitHub Pages serves the frontend.
Development and release operations target Windows/WSL and Linux; the
[infrastructure notes](docs/agent-notes/0.4.0/release-and-infrastructure.md)
distinguish verified paths from remaining work. Source publication is continuous
work; production deployment is a verified outcome.
