# Lowlands audio direction

Warpkeep treats sound as a scene layer, not a page-global loop:

```text
title score ──1.7 s──▶ Hegemony menu score ──2.3 s──▶ Lowlands score
     ▲                         ▲                         │
     └──────────────1.7 s──────┴──────────1.9 s──────────┘
```

The title and menu preserve their existing behavior. An authenticated `ENTER REALM` gesture prepares the Lowlands pair and begins the menu-to-realm handoff before the route changes. Returning to the menu retains both musical positions for the mounted session; sign-out fades realm audio to menu and resets Lowlands for a future account/session.

## Lowlands loop

`Lowlands of Hegemony` is a hot master with a deliberate quiet tail. Native looping would jump from near silence to the opening, so the director owns two cached realm audio elements and schedules an equal-power crossfade:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime gain | `0.37` |
| Outgoing overlap start | `236.000000 s` |
| Decoded endpoint | `244.919979 s` |
| Overlap | `8.919979 s` |
| Menu → realm | `2300 ms` |
| Realm → menu | `1900 ms` |

The realm elements have no `src` until an authenticated realm is prepared. This prevents Lowlands audio requests from anonymous title, menu, QR, and deep-link views. The complete source and runtime integrity record lives in [`../reference/audio/2026-07-11-lowlands-of-hegemony/`](../reference/audio/2026-07-11-lowlands-of-hegemony/).
